		<h1>Hello Paul!</h1>
		<p>Please take my apologies for the text in my profile, I'm a very open person and I didn't think to much about it when I did the profile. If necessary I can provide my apologies to anyone who felt unconfortable with this.</p>

		<p>Now the profile is modified to follow the request. I want to be in the next steps of the program, so I will follow all requests without question.</p>

		<p>About the channel <em>#women</em>, that is a challenge I decided to take in order to learn more, but is not easy, I you see my questions in the udacity forum you will see that I love to make questions and in this women channel they state that: <em>"Women are extremely underrepresented in Tech and IT. This group allows us to support and encourage one another. :raising_hand:"</em></p>

		<p>So, as I said to them I want to show them that there is no "underrepresented" in this course, actually the oposite is happening I'm learing a lot from them, I didn't expected that and is very positive to me. I agree with you, is better to make my technical questions in other channels more suitable for it.</p>

		<p>Unfortunally I can not show you the messages I'm going to present in the following text but I guess you can see them, or you have seen them.</p>

		<p>I've read again the code of conduct, and it saids:</p>

		<p><strong><em>"...let's make the effort to keep the conversations free of any conflict..."</em></strong></p>

		<p>I received one answer to one of my questions from <strong>U7V9X8MRR</strong> where she said that my questions where span. I haven't seen anywhwere in slack or the udacity forum another comment like that, then I can not accept it.</p>

		<p>The code of conduct, also saids:</p>

		<p><strong><em>"...Please do not send comments to other Scholarship participants that can be seen as harassment.* This includes, but is not limited to, flirting, hostile PMs, personal attacks or remarks on their physical appearance..."</em></strong></p>

		<p>I received a hostile comment in the same thead from <strong>U7VDA2WTV</strong> where she was <strong>sarcastic</strong> about me, she said that <em>"...somebody making so much questions shows his low skills in searching in google or others places..."</em> that was a not a <em>constructive feedback</em> in any way it is completely agresive to me.</p>

		<p>The code of conduct, also saids:</p>

		<p><strong><em>"...*Please be considerate and respectful of others as <span style="color:#0000ff">hurtful language will not be tolerated.* Sexist, racist and other exclusionary remarks risk not only your removal from the Slack channels but also your enrollment in the Scholarship program from the very first offense....</span>"</em></strong></p>

		<p>if you read the post I did today at 8:51am (I think the link is this: U7VDA2WTV) you can see how I feel in this group, some ladies where kind to me and they said <em>"that is ok, go on don't take it personal</em>. I agree. But, when I read the code of conduct again: (I will repeat it here)</p>

		<p><em>"Sexist, racist and other <span style="color:#ff0000;">exclusionary remarks</span> risk not only your removal from the Slack channels but also your enrollment in the Scholarship program from the very first offense...."</em></p>

		<p>I've been excluded !</p>
		<p>When I ask if someone else was using Linux on of them asked me: <strong><em>Why you want to know that?</em></strong></p>

		<p>I'm willing to correct my mistakes and keep learning, I expect also that the code of conduct is applied to those who presented a non-acceptable behavior to me.</p>

		<p>Once again, please accept my apologies for this unconfortable situation and please look my willing to improve. </p>

		<p>Thank you,</p>

		<p><em>Jaime Andres</em></p>

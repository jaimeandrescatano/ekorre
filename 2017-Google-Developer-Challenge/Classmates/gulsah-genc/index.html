			<p class="paragraph">Emperors are the largest of all penguins.These flightless animals live on the Antarctic   ice and in the frigid surrounding waters.  They are mostly known for their parenting. While the male penguin protects the egg,   the female penguin goes to find food and  returns  with a full belly.</p>

You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

    * What new skills have you learned?
        I've learn to search in new websites like http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1f525/index.htm 
        I've learn to use the figure tag with a more technical approach, because all the time I use just the <img> tag.
        
    * What has been easy?
        At the moment all the exersizes has been easy
        Using the websites like MDN is also easy 
        
    * What has been difficult?
        I tried to find the same font used in the first mockup exersize but it was difficult, I think that maybe the rendering of the browser used is the reason to see slightly different the font. 
        
    * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
        I find the relation between the representation of a single item (paragraph, image etc.) in the mockup image and the html tags that I can use to get the "visual effect". 
        If I don't remember which tag should be used then I go to the MDN to find alternatives.
        Then I write the code in my text editor and then I render the page in my web browser, if the visual effect matches the mockup image then I continue to the next item. 
        At the end I compare the whole html page with the mockup image to verify that every item has the same size, shape and the distances between the text lines, the images etc.
